# Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array and return it. In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5..... (considering the increasing lexicographical order).

# Input Format:
# The first line contains an integer T, depicting total number of test cases. T testcases follow. The first line of each testcase contains an integer N depicting the size of the array. The second line contains N space separated elements of the array.

# Output Format:
# For each testcase, in a new line, print the array into wave-like array.

# User Task:
# The task is to complete the function convertToWave() which converts the given array to wave array. The newline is automatically added by the driver code.

# Constraints:
# 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
# 1 ≤ N ≤ 106
# 0 ≤ A[i] ≤107

# Example:
# Input:
# 2
# 5
# 1 2 3 4 5
# 6
# 2 4 7 8 9 10

# Output:
# 2 1 4 3 5
# 4 2 8 7 10 9

# Explanation:
# Testcase 1: Array elements after sorting it in wave form are 2 1 4 3 5.

def convertToWave(arr,n):
    arr.sort()
    for i in range(0,n-1,2):
        arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
                
    return arr

arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(convertToWave(arr,5))
