**Tip:** I use Google's C++ Style for coding. You can also pick any style and start coding so that your code can be easily interpreted by others.

**I recommend taking this course as it contains extraordinary content and perfectly instructed by Sandeep Jain (ex-DE Shaw employee and ex-JIIT Noida assistant professor) who founded GeeksForGeeks to impart programming education at very low cost. I purchased this course in ₹ 2,000/- and really worth it.**
